# Vehicle Builder
## Description
This is an application that allows a user to create a vehicle, specify certain properties for the vehicle, and make the vehicle take some basic actions such as start or turn left/right. I created this app to learn more about Object Oriented Programming in TypeScript. See the [Usage section](#usage) below for more information about what the app can do. <br><br>

## Installation
To run the app, download the repository from GitHub and run the index.ts file in your computer terminal. 
## Usage
The program is run entirely from the terminal. Run the index.ts file, found in the 'src' folder, to initialize the application. Then follow the application's prompts. <br>
First, you can either create a new vehicle or choose from a list of existing vehicles. If you chose to create a new vehicle, you can choose if you'd like to create a truck, car or motorbike (there are one of each saved as presets if you chose to use a premade vehicle). Once you have selected or made a vehicle, choose form an assortment of actions: 
- print vehicle details
- start the vehicle
- accelerate by 5 mph
- decelerate by 5mph
- stop the vdehicle
- turn right
- turn left
- reverse the vehicle
- tow (only allowable with "Truck" type vehicles)
- perform a wheelie (only allowable with "Motorbike" type vehicles)
- Select another vehicle (broken; will be fixed in future versions)
- exit program (broken; will be fixed in future versions. For now, input ^C to leave program)

There are known bugs in this program. It is a work in progress!
