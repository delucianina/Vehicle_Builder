# Vehicle Builder
## Description
This is an application that allows a user to create a vehicle, specify certain properties for the vehicle, and make the vehicle take some basic actions such as start or turn left/right. I created this app to learn more about Object Oriented Programming in TypeScript. See the [Usage section](#usage) below for more information about what the app can do. <br><br>
